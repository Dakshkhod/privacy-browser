# PrivacyLens Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (No API Key Required)

The tool works immediately without any setup! It provides intelligent, privacy-focused alternatives using a curated database.

## ü§ñ Enhanced AI-Powered Alternatives (Optional)

To enable ChatGPT-powered alternative suggestions for all users, you can set up a centralized API key:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

1. Get an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export CENTRALIZED_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

### Option 2: .env File

Create a `.env` file in the Backend directory:
```env
CENTRALIZED_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Option 3: System Environment

On Windows:
```cmd
set CENTRALIZED_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

```bash
export CENTRALIZED_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
