**Possible causes:**

**Solutions:**

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Finding Privacy Policy URLs

2. **Look for "Privacy Policy" links** in navigation menus
3. **Common URL patterns**:
   - `/privacy`
   - `/privacy-policy`
   - `/legal/privacy`
   - `/policies/privacy`
4. **Use search engines**: Search for "[site name] privacy policy"

- `https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy`
